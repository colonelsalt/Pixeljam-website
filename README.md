#Â PixelJam Website

Website for UCL's 2017 game jam, PixelJam.

## Setting up

To set up run, `npm install` and then run `gulp`.

## Making changes

_SCSS_ is in use, so change SCSS files in `/src/_*.scss`.

Gulp doesn't currently watch your files, so you have to run gulp every time you make a change to SCSS (feel free to change this!)

The rest of it is standard HTML code being used.

*gh-pages* is the master branch that's hooked to [the live site](http://porticode.io)

## Credits

The initial build of this site was developed by Matt Bell and succeeded by Vicky Dineshchandra, originally created for Porticode (a 2016 hacakthon).
Altered by Sondre Agledahl for use with PixelJam 2017.
